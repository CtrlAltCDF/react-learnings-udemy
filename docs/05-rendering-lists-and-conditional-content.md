# rendering Lists

- always use a key
- map and filter on an array are you friend

# conditional content

- if you are solely rendering a component out, use a parent component to output the child based on logic
- you can use truantry operators to output JSX
- you can assign JSX to variables above the functional component
- same goes for logic blocks with JSX in them

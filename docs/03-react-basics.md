# React Basics

React is a JS library for building user interfaces. It adds complexity, however for complex apps it makes development easier.

## What are components

---

components are reusable and reactive blocks of JSX which contain HTML, CSS and Javascript that allow us to separate concerns. Component usage often looks like custom HTML elements that take in custom developer defined attributes.

## Declarative approach

---

You the developer, create the desired target/end states(s) and React figures out the javascript DOM instructions
